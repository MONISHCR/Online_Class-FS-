You are playing a treasure hunt game in your college,all the particepents  need to start from a 0th location. When you find a hint you need to visit that location, If any one visit all locations he/she will be the winner. When you visit a location you may find a set of hints in it. Each hint leads to another location, and you can take all of them with you and visit those locations.

Given an array locations where each  locations[i] may consists of some hints,
Return true if you are able to visit all the locations otherwise false.

input format : an integer n (number of locations)
			   space seperated integers (hints placed in each locations,if there is no hint in the location then emptyspace)
output format : true or false

Example 1:
Input= 4
1
2
3
	// location 4 doesnot have any hint so empty space
Output: true
Explanation: 
We visit location 0 and pick up hint 1.
We then visit location 1 and pick up hint 2.
We then visit location 2 and pick up hint 3.
We then visit location 3.
Since we were able to visit every location, we return true.

Example 2:
Input=4
1 3
3 0 1
2
0
Output=false
Explanation: We can not enter location 2 since the only hint that leads to it is in that location .

Constraints:
n == location.length
2 <= n <= 1000
0 <= location[i].length <= 1000
1 <= sum(location[i].length) <= 3000
0 <= locations[i][j] < n
All the values of locations[i] are unique.
