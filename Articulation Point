A vertex is said to be an articulation point in a graph if removal of the vertex and associated edges disconnects the graph. So, the removal of articulation points increases the number of connected components in a graph.

The main aim here is to find out all the articulations points in a graph.


Example 1:
input=5
5
1 0
0 2
2 1
0 3
3 4
output=[0, 3]

Example 2:
input=4
3
0 1
1 2
2 3
output=[1, 2]
Example 3:
input=7
8
0 1 
1 2
2 0 
1 3
1 4
1 6
3 5
4 5

output=[1]
Example 4
input=5
4
0 1
1 2
2 3
3 4
output= [1, 2, 3]
