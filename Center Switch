In computer networks we have star topology. Which is like an undirected graph consisting of n switces labeled from 1 to n. A Start topology is a LAN where there is one center node and exactly n-1 connections that connect the ceter switch with every other switch.

You will be given a 2D array connections where each connections[i]=[ui, vi] indicates that there is connection between switches ui and vi. Return the center of the star topology.

Example 1:
input = 4
3
0 1
1 2
3 1
output=1
Explanation: node 1 is connected to every other node, so 2 is the center.

Example 2:
Input: 5
4
0 1
4 0
0 2
0 3
Output=0
 
Constraints:

3 <= n <= 105
edges.length == n - 1
edges[i].length == 2
1 <= ui, vi <= n
ui != vi
The given edges represent a valid star graph.
